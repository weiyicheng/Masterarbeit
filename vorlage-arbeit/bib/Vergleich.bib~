abstract = {In an era of seemingly e-everything e-commerce is changing the way people do business and impacting shopping habits. Increasingly this change has an international dimension in both trans-national transactions and exporting e-commerce business models from one culture to another. Typically this last element has involved exporting Western e-business models to the rest of the world. However, it is unclear if an e-commerce business model developed in one cultural environment would be suitable for another culture. This paper attempts to explore this question by investigating two cases: amazon.co.uk in the West (UK) and dangdang.com in the East (China). In addition, differences between countries may be due to deep embedded cultural aspects, differences in infrastructure and business environment or a mix of these. The study in this paper draws upon secondary data, primary interview data and survey data of user practices. Amazon.com is probably one of the most written about e-commerce cases and there is a much secondary data to support an investigation. Dangdang.com is less well know and covered in the literature (at least in the West) so face-to-face interview data is used to develop the case study. To understand user practices the study uses survey data, focusing on selected groups in Beijing (China) and Portsmouth (UK). To help investigate and analyze the two cases this paper draws upon Hofstede's cultural works, particularly the individualism vs. collectivism cultural dimension. For the case studies, different cultural aspects and differences in the infrastructure and business environment are identified. Differences in user practices and the environment seems to indicate that e-commerce business models suitable for the West may not be totally suitable for the East},

This article presents the first cross-cultural study on eWOM in SNSs by examining social relationship variables between the United States and China. Specifically, social capital, tie strength, trust, and interpersonal influence were examined as potential predictors of eWOM communication in the emerging online social channels. The results suggest that national culture plays a significant factor that affects consumers’ engagement in eWOM in SNSs in the two countries. Theoretical and managerial implications for global Internet marketers were presented and discussed.},

abstract = {Humor preferences depend on the cultural background of the respondents. Designers of international advertising campaigns thus need to know how to adapt ads to the target market. The present paper runs two studies to test (1) whether marketers actually adapt the type of humor to the culture of the target market and (2) whether different types of humor elicit different effects in different cultures. Both studies use the example of Germany and Spain for cross-cultural comparisons. Study 1 analyzes 418 Spanish and 748 German print advertisements. The results indicate that marketers apply humor in Spain more frequently than in Germany. The type of humor differs across the two countries: Comic wit which builds on incongruent elements is more frequent in Germany (low-context, individualistic, masculine culture) than in Spain (high-context, collectivistic, feminine culture) while Spanish ads contain more sentimental humor. This humor type transports warmly messages without including incongruent messages. Study 2 examines whether the cultural dimensions of individualism and femininity affect attitude towards sentimental humor ads and sentimental comedy ads. The latter type of humor combines warm elements with the principle of incongruity- resolution. The study shows that Spanish respondents rate sentimental humor significantly more positive than German respondents. In contrast, German subjects evaluate sentimental comedy most positive. Implications for managers and future research are derived.},

The spread of positive word of mouth (WOM) and the lack of negative WOM about the product or brand by early adopter groups are critical to the product's successful diffusion in a population. This is the first study to investigate the effects of consumers' cultural values on their WOM behavior. Data analysis from two samples indicates that the pattern, type, and target receivers of consumers' WOM activity depend on their cultural values. The authors use Hofstede's four cultural dimensions to test the effects of cultural values on WOM behavior to social in- and out-groups. They find that all four dimensions have significant effects on WOM engagement to those groups.

abstract = {To succeed in the two largest apparel markets in the world, apparel companies need to fully understand their consumers’ perceptions of apparel quality. The purposes of this study are: 1) to identify and compare attributes that are important in consumers’ perceptions of apparel quality in the U.S. and China; and, 2) to explore a new approach to consumer study in the apparel industry. Product reviews about Levi’s women’s skinny jeans from five different online retailers in the U.S. and China were sampled and analyzed. Perceptions were categorized into three dimensions with 14 different factors: aesthetics (color, pattern, style, appearance, versatility and workmanship), performance (fit, comfort, durability and care) and extrinsic (brand, cost and service). After data screening and cleaning, 243 reviews from the U.S. and 172 reviews from China were collected. Descriptive analysis was conducted for factor frequencies mentioned in the comments. Regression analysis was used to explore each attribute’s influence on the overall evaluation (rating star). Chi-square tests were conducted to compare the perception differences between the U.S. and Chinese consumers. Descriptive analysis showed that for the U.S. consumers, fit, comfort, appearance, style, color, versatility, brand and durability were important factors; for the Chinese consumers, the most cited attributes were fit, comfort, appearance, style, color, cost, other, service and brand. Regression results indicated that evaluations about durability, fit, brand, style, appearance and comfort had significant positive impact on the U.S. consumers’ overall product ratings; other, service, color, comfort and appearance influenced Chinese consumers’ overall evaluation of an item. The importance of “other” attribute indicated the importance of fabric properties in Chinese consumers’ mind. Chi-square tests showed that comparing to the U.S. consumers, Chinese consumers are more sensitive to cost, fabric properties and service, but care less about fit, versatility, durability and care. Deeper investigations on the comment contents got some interesting findings such as Chinese consumers prefer jeans that make them look slimmer and tend to blame themselves for not fitting. Companies can use such information to improve their product development and marketing strategies in the target country. The results of this study were highly influenced and limited by the product type and the special characteristics of online shopping and online comments. To get a more comprehensive view of consumers’ perceptions of apparel quality in different countries, future studies may sample more products with larger sample sizes and apply online comments analysis along with other research methods.},

The authors contribute to research on this topic by proposing a positive effect of received WOM on service quality perceptions among existing customers. Moreover, they predict that cultural values moderate this effect. They test the model on 1910 bank customers in 11 countries. The results show that received WOM has a positive effect on customer service quality perceptions. Furthermore, received WOM has a stronger effect on the evaluation of customers in high-uncertainty-avoidance than in low-uncertainty-avoidance cultures.
