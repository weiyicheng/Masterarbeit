abstract = {In an era of seemingly e-everything e-commerce is changing the way people do business and impacting shopping habits. Increasingly this change has an international dimension in both trans-national transactions and exporting e-commerce business models from one culture to another. Typically this last element has involved exporting Western e-business models to the rest of the world. However, it is unclear if an e-commerce business model developed in one cultural environment would be suitable for another culture. This paper attempts to explore this question by investigating two cases: amazon.co.uk in the West (UK) and dangdang.com in the East (China). In addition, differences between countries may be due to deep embedded cultural aspects, differences in infrastructure and business environment or a mix of these. The study in this paper draws upon secondary data, primary interview data and survey data of user practices. Amazon.com is probably one of the most written about e-commerce cases and there is a much secondary data to support an investigation. Dangdang.com is less well know and covered in the literature (at least in the West) so face-to-face interview data is used to develop the case study. To understand user practices the study uses survey data, focusing on selected groups in Beijing (China) and Portsmouth (UK). To help investigate and analyze the two cases this paper draws upon Hofstede's cultural works, particularly the individualism vs. collectivism cultural dimension. For the case studies, different cultural aspects and differences in the infrastructure and business environment are identified. Differences in user practices and the environment seems to indicate that e-commerce business models suitable for the West may not be totally suitable for the East},

Data from lab experiments and actual online retailers suggest that consumers who evaluate products associated with promotion consumption goals perceive positive reviews to be more persuasive than negative ones (i.e., a positivity bias). Conversely, consumers who evaluate products associated with prevention consumption goals perceive negative reviews to be more persuasive than positive ones (i.e., a negativity bias). ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

Drawing on findings from research on virtual communities and traditional word-of-mouth literature, a typology for motives of consumer online articulation is developed. Using an online sample of some 2,000 consumers, information on the structure and relevance of the motives of consumers' online articulations is generated. The resulting analysis suggests that consumers' desire for social interaction, desire for economic incentives, their concern for other consumers, and the potential to enhance their own self-worth are the primary factors leading to eWOM behavior. Further, eWOM providers can be grouped based on what motivates their behavior, suggesting that firms may need to develop different strategies for encouraging eWOM behavior among their users.},

Four operational models of etailing are discussed in the context of their intertwining relations with different forms of parcel express services. This co-evolution generated compound outcomes because of the late start of PEI and the fast growth of online shopping in China. These four models coexist, with two standing out as major types that suggest future directions. Two major geographical imprints of this process are explained and conceptualized: (1) the zonal delivery strategy by supply-chain-based e-merchants, which is conceptualized into a choice model of order-fulfilling locations to strengthen timely delivery; and (2) the Baoyou strategy advocated by e-market-based retailers and their logistic support for a slower, low-cost market of larger geographical coverage compared to the first strategy. Both strategies demonstrate that co-evolution is not only a path-dependent process but is also associated with place-dependent institutions.},

The agent-based simulation is a methodology that is well suited for modeling collective diffusion dynamics. Using optimal pricing mechanism and industry data, we introduce an agent-based model to replicate the evolution process of market share for multiple brands competing online. The proposed model helps understand the role of knowledge in the diffusion of competitive brands. It shows that when multiple brands face online competition, innovativeness, brand image, self-perceived utility and electronic word of mouth (e-WOM) all have significant effect on online shoppers’ decisions and have a bearing on brands’ market performance. Consumers often derive their value (utility) of a brand based on price, quality, rating, etc. When consumers rely more on self-perceived utility, e-WOM has more positive effects on market share. Depending on whether a firm's competitive advantage is in innovation, price, web content, or use of social media, different online strategies should be employed for different brands to achieve market success.},

abstract = {This study investigated relationships among website quality, perceived information quality, perceived value, and loyalty intentions in the context of apparel online shopping. Analysis of data using structural equation modeling showed that among the website quality dimensions, interactivity, online completeness, ease of use, and entertainment significantly influence perceived information quality. Perceived information quality affects perceived value and loyalty intentions and perceived value influences loyalty intentions toward apparel retail websites. The post-hoc test revealed that entertainment and trust affect perceived value. Online completeness and entertainment were found to influence loyalty intentions. Strategic suggestions are provided for e-retailer improvement of website information quality, such as utilizing entertaining and engaging devices and designing their websites for consumer comprehension and enjoyment during the shopping experience.},

abstract = {This study explores the relationship among product attributes, web browsing, and impulse buying for apparel products in the Internet context. University students completed a total of 356 usable questionnaires. Data analysis was conducted using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling via LISREL 8.8. Findings confirm that apparel product attributes consist of three factors: variety of selection, price, and sensory attributes. The study confirms that two types of web browsing occur: utilitarian and hedonic. In an estimated structural model, the variety of selection has a positive effect on utilitarian web browsing, whereas price has a positive effect on hedonic web browsing. Additionally, utilitarian web browsing has a negative effect on impulse buying, whereas hedonic web browsing has a positive effect on impulse buying for apparel on shopping websites. In particular, the factors of variety of selection and sensory attributes have direct effects on e-impulse buying for apparel. Managerial implications for more effectively managing the process of securing online customers through the use of utilitarian and hedonic product information concludes the article.},

Data were obtained from 77 articles published from 1994 to 2009 in 35 journals. The articles were categorized according to their applicability into three basic sectors – textile production, apparel manufacture, and distribution/sales. They were further categorized into 16 subsectors based on their operational and management/control processes. A comprehensive list of categorized journal articles identified in this study provides insights and relevant references for both researchers and practitioners on the application of decision support and intelligent systems to various stages of a textile and apparel supply chain. In light of the developed classification framework, we identify gaps in extending the use of the decision support and artificial intelligent systems in the industry and suggest potential and applicable research areas for further consideration in this subject area.},

abstract = {Purchase intentions for apparel products often require physical examination prior to purchase. Hence, greater risk is associated with shopping online for apparel products, making it important to examine factors that reduce various risks influencing online purchase intentions. This study examines and compares the impact of two of the most important risk reducers for online apparel shopping – product brand image and online store image – on specific types of perceived risks and online purchase intentions for apparel. The results show that product brand image influences consumers' online purchase intentions both directly and indirectly by reducing various risk perceptions. Online store image impacts purchase intentions indirectly by decreasing risk perceptions. The results of this study provide fresh insight into understanding the impact of product brand image and online store image on each type of perceived risk associated with online shopping.},

abstract = {This study explores the dynamics of online service personalization in the online apparel retailing context, with regard to customers’ actual online shopping activities. From an empirical study of American Internet shoppers (n=204), three types of widely-used online service personalization, that is (i) offer, (ii) recognition, and (iii) personal advice, were identified. Moreover, grounded by the Theory of Reasoned Action [Fishbein, M., Ajzen, I., 1975. Belief, Attitudes, Intention, Behavior: An Introduction to Theory and Research. Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA], relationships between customers’ online service personalization attitudes and their online shopping activities—regarding apparel items—have been investigated. Findings of this study empirically present the dynamics of online service personalization in the context of online apparel retailing. Also, the results show that customer online shopping experiences may impact on their online service personalization attitudes. Theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed regarding online service management. Based on the results, Internet-based apparel retailers may benefit from developing various types of personalization services by enhancing shopping intentions of their customers, in particular, of those who are loyal to the retailers.},

A sample of 429 female college students participated in this online experiment. The results show the effectiveness of using a realistic human model on apparel websites. Also, consumers who are highly involved with clothing generally exhibit more positive responses than those who are less involved. Overall, these findings provide empirical support for the Stimulus-Organism-Response model and the Elaboration Likelihood Model, and contribute useful knowledge regarding website design for online apparel retailers.},

abstract = {To succeed in the two largest apparel markets in the world, apparel companies need to fully understand their consumers’ perceptions of apparel quality. The purposes of this study are: 1) to identify and compare attributes that are important in consumers’ perceptions of apparel quality in the U.S. and China; and, 2) to explore a new approach to consumer study in the apparel industry. Product reviews about Levi’s women’s skinny jeans from five different online retailers in the U.S. and China were sampled and analyzed. Perceptions were categorized into three dimensions with 14 different factors: aesthetics (color, pattern, style, appearance, versatility and workmanship), performance (fit, comfort, durability and care) and extrinsic (brand, cost and service). After data screening and cleaning, 243 reviews from the U.S. and 172 reviews from China were collected. Descriptive analysis was conducted for factor frequencies mentioned in the comments. Regression analysis was used to explore each attribute’s influence on the overall evaluation (rating star). Chi-square tests were conducted to compare the perception differences between the U.S. and Chinese consumers. Descriptive analysis showed that for the U.S. consumers, fit, comfort, appearance, style, color, versatility, brand and durability were important factors; for the Chinese consumers, the most cited attributes were fit, comfort, appearance, style, color, cost, other, service and brand. Regression results indicated that evaluations about durability, fit, brand, style, appearance and comfort had significant positive impact on the U.S. consumers’ overall product ratings; other, service, color, comfort and appearance influenced Chinese consumers’ overall evaluation of an item. The importance of “other” attribute indicated the importance of fabric properties in Chinese consumers’ mind. Chi-square tests showed that comparing to the U.S. consumers, Chinese consumers are more sensitive to cost, fabric properties and service, but care less about fit, versatility, durability and care. Deeper investigations on the comment contents got some interesting findings such as Chinese consumers prefer jeans that make them look slimmer and tend to blame themselves for not fitting. Companies can use such information to improve their product development and marketing strategies in the target country. The results of this study were highly influenced and limited by the product type and the special characteristics of online shopping and online comments. To get a more comprehensive view of consumers’ perceptions of apparel quality in different countries, future studies may sample more products with larger sample sizes and apply online comments analysis along with other research methods.},

It is one of the most active research areas in natural language processing and is also widely studied in data mining, Web mining, and text mining. In fact, this research has spread outside of computer science to the management sciences and social sciences due to its importance to business and society as a whole. The growing importance of sentiment analysis coincides with the growth of social media such as reviews, forum discussions, blogs, micro-blogs, Twitter, and social networks. For the first time in human history, we now have a huge volume of opinionated data recorded in digital form for analysis. Sentiment analysis systems are being applied in almost every business and social domain because opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key influencers of our behaviors.
