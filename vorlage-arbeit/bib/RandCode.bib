abstract = {Text mining is an emerging technology that can be used to augment existing data in corporate databases by making unstructured text data available for analysis. An excellent introduction to text mining is provided by Weiss, et al. (2005). Francis (2006) provides a short introduction to text mining with a focus on insurance applications. One of the difficulties in getting started with text mining is acquiring the tools, i.e., the software for implementing text mining. Much of the software is expensive and/or difficult to use. For instance, some of the software requires purchase of expensive data mining suites. Other commercial software is more suited to large scale industrial strength applications such as cataloging and searching academic papers. One innovation that has made budget-friendly software available to text miners is open source software. Two of the very popular open source products that will be featured in this paper are R and Perl. R is a programming language that has wide acceptance for statistical and applied mathematical applications. Perl is a programming language that is particularly strong in text processing. Both languages can be easily downloaded from the Internet. Moreover, a large body of literature now exists to guide users through specialized applications such as text mining. This paper will rely heavily on information in the book Practical Text Mining in Perl by Roger Bilisoly (2008) when illustrating text mining applications in Perl. It will also rely heavily on the R tm library. While this library is described by Feinerer, Hornik, and Meyer (2008), the applications are not insurance applications, and a significant amount of trial and error can be required to achieve successful application of the software to insurance problems. We hope to make it easier for potential users to employ Perl and/or R for insurance text mining projects by illustrating their application to insurance problems with detailed information on the code and functions needed to perform the different text mining tasks. In this paper we will illustrate the application of the text mining software using two applications: 1) analyzing a free-form accident description field in an insurance claims database and 2) analyzing free-form comments in a survey of actuaries. Both applications involve relatively small text fields, compared to those anticipated by many text mining products. We will also show how text mining can be used to generate new information from the unstructured text data.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a recently published Python data mining book (chapters, topics, samples of Python source code written by its authors) to be used in data mining via world wide web and any specific database in several disciplines (economic, physics, education, marketing. etc). The book started with an introduction to data mining by explaining some of the data mining tasks involved classification, dependence modelling, clustering and discovery of association rules. The book addressed that using Python in data mining has been gaining some interest from data miner community due to its open source, general purpose programming and web scripting language; furthermore, it is a cross platform and it can be run on a wide variety of operating systens such as Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, Macintosh, Solaris, OS/2, Amiga, AROS, AS/400, BeOS, OS/390, z/OS, Palm OS, QNX, VMS, Psion, Acorn RISC OS, VxWorks, PlayStation, Sharp Zaurus, Windows CE and even PocketPC. Finally this book can be considered as a teaching textbook for data mining in which several methods such as machine learning and statistics are used to extract high-level knowledge from real-world datasets.},

abstract = {R and Data Mining introduces researchers, post-graduate students, and analysts to data mining using R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The book provides practical methods for using R in applications from academia to industry to extract knowledge from vast amounts of data. Readers will find this book a valuable guide to the use of R in tasks such as classification and prediction, clustering, outlier detection, association rules, sequence analysis, text mining, social network analysis, sentiment analysis, and more. Data mining techniques are growing in popularity in a broad range of areas, from banking to insurance, retail, telecom, medicine, research, and government. This book focuses on the modeling phase of the data mining process, also addressing data exploration and model evaluation. With three in-depth case studies, a quick reference guide, bibliography, and links to a wealth of online resources, R and Data Mining is a valuable, practical guide to a powerful method of analysis.},
