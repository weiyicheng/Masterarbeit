abstract = {A large number of online customer reviews greatly influences consumer purchasing decisions. Whether positive or negative, consumers regard online customer reviews as providing useful information. Based on the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), this study focuses on the factors of the central and peripheral route in online customer reviews that make readers feel they are trustworthy and helpful. In addition, the researchers are interested in the impact of social factors in the reviews on consumers. Using content analysis, the study analyzes 983 customer reviews from restaurant review websites. Results show that the larger reviewer's number of followers, the higher level of expertise of the reviewer, the larger image count and word count also make readers feel the review is more practical and useful. Further, the influence of the peripheral route, the social factors, on readers is higher than that of central route factors.},

abstract = {The notion of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) communication has received considerable attention in both business and academic communities. Numerous studies have been conducted to examine the effectiveness of eWOM communication. The scope of published studies on the impact of eWOM communication is large and fragmented and little effort has been made to integrate the findings of prior studies and evaluate the status of the research in this area. In this study, we conducted a systematic review of eWOM research. Building upon our literature analysis, we used the social communication framework to summarize and classify prior eWOM studies. We further identified key factors related to the major elements of the social communication literature and built an integrative framework explaining the impact of eWOM communication on consumer behavior. We believe that the framework will provide an important foundation for future eWOM research work.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis is the process of extracting knowledge from the peoples’ opinions, appraisals and emotions toward entities, events and their attributes. These opinions greatly impact on customers to make their choices regarding online shopping, choosing events, products and entities. With the rapid growth of online resources, discussion groups, forums and blogs; people communicate through these means of internet on daily basis. As a result, the vast amount of new data in the form of customer reviews and opinions are being generated progressively. So it is desired to develop an efficient and effective sentiment analysis system for online customer reviews and comments. In this study, the rule based domain independent sentiment analysis method is proposed. The proposed method classifies subjective and objective sentences from reviews and blog comments. The semantic score of subjective sentences is extracted from SentiWordNet to calculate their polarity as positive, negative or neutral based on the contextual sentence structure. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method and it outperforms the word level and machine learning methods. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 97.8\% at the feedback level and 86.6\% at the sentence level.},

abstract = {Online customer reviews (OCRs) have become a major source of information for customers in the Internet. Understanding the impact of OCRs on customers' decisions is an important challenge for academics and practitioners. We apply a choice-based conjoint experiment that combines all relevant levels of the OCR dimensions (valence, volume, and variance) and that estimates the effect of OCRs on choice. The experimental setting allows us to estimate the direct effects but also the interaction effects of the OCR dimensions, which have been largely neglected in previous research. The impact of the OCR dimensions is evaluated against the results from a control group that did not face OCRs when making their choices. Therefore, our experiment enables us to investigate the extent to which the presence of OCRs affects customers' consideration of brand, price, and technical product attributes. By contrast to previous findings, our results show that volume and variance do not affect customers' choices directly but that they moderate the impact of valence on customers' choices. Moreover, we find that OCRs decrease the importance of brand for customer purchase decisions, indicating that managing OCRs have become a challenge for brand management.},

abstract = {Online user-generated product reviews have become an indispensible tool for consumers and thus for retailers who want to attract and retain consumers. Yet, relatively little is known about what causes consumers to find an online peer review helpful to their shopping tasks. Prior research examines mostly the effects of product reviews on consumer product attitude, product choice, and product sales. This paper, however, provides an analysis of the determinants of review helpfulness. In two studies, we examine the effects of review characteristics, product type, and reviewer characteristics on perceived review helpfulness. With data collected from a real online retailer, we provide empirical evidence to support our conceptual predictions. Specifically, both review valence and length have positive effects on review helpfulness, but the product type (i.e., experiential vs. utilitarian product) moderates these effects. Using content analysis of reviews, we develop a measure of expressed reviewer innovativeness (i.e., the predisposition toward new products as revealed in review content). A curvilinear relationship exists between expressed reviewer innovativeness and review helpfulness. These findings lead to pertinent managerial implications. ?? 2011 New York University.},

abstract = {In this paper, we dedicate to the topic of aspect ranking, which aims to automatically identify important product aspects from online consumer reviews. The important aspects are identified according to two observations: (a) the important aspects of a product are usually commented by a large number of consumers; and (b) consumers opinions on the important aspects greatly influence their overall opinions on the product. In particular, given consumer reviews of a product, we first identify the product aspects by a shallow dependency parser and determine consumers opinions on these aspects via a sentiment classifier. We then develop an aspect ranking algorithm to identify the important aspects by simultaneously considering the aspect frequency and the influence of consumers opinions given to each aspect on their overall opinions. The experimental results on 11 popular products in four domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We further apply the aspect ranking results to the application of documentlevel sentiment classification, and improve the performance significantly.},

abstract = {Recently, many e-commerce Web sites, such as Amazon.com, provide platforms for users to review products and share their opinions, in order to help consumers make their best purchase decisions. However, the quality and the level of helpfulness of different product reviews are not disclosed to consumers unless they carefully analyze an immense number of lengthy reviews. Considering the large amount of available online product reviews, this is an impossible task for any consumer. Therefore, it is of vital importance to develop recommender systems that can evaluate online product reviews effectively to recommend the most useful ones to consumers. This paper proposes an information gain-based model to predict the helpfulness of online product reviews, with the aim of suggesting the most suitable products and vendors to consumers. Reviews are analyzed and ranked by our scoring model and reviews that help consumers better than others will be found. In addition, we also compare our model with several machine learning algorithms. Our experimental results show that our approach is effective in ranking and classifying online product reviews.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {Enabled by Web 2.0 technologies, social media provide an unparalleled platform for consumers to share their product experiences and opinions through word-of-mouth (WOM) or consumer reviews. It has become increasingly important to understand how WOM content and metrics influence consumer purchases and product sales. By integrating marketing theories with text mining techniques, we propose a set of novel measures that focus on sentiment divergence in consumer product reviews. To test the validity of these metrics, we conduct an empirical study based on data from Amazon.com and BN.com (Barnes \& Noble). The results demonstrate significant effects of our proposed measures on product sales. This effect is not fully captured by nontextual review measures such as numerical ratings. Furthermore, in capturing the sales effect of review content, our divergencemetrics are shown to be superior to andmore appropriate than some commonly used textual measures the literature. The findings provide important insights into the business impact of social media and user-generated content, an emerging problem in business intelligence research. From amanagerial perspective, our results suggest that firms should pay special attention to textual content information when managing social media and, more importantly, focus on the right measures},
