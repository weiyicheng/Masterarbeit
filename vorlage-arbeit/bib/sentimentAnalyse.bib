abstract = {Sentiment Analysis (SA), also called Opinion Mining, is currently one of the most studied research fields. It aims to analyze people’s sentiments, opinions, attitudes, emotions, etc., towards elements such as topics, products, individuals, organizations, and services. Different techniques and software tools are being developed to carry out Sentiment Analysis. The goal of this work is to review and compare some free access web services, analyzing their capabilities to classify and score different pieces of text with respect to the sentiments contained therein. For that purpose, three well-known collections have been used to perform several experiments whose results are shown and commented upon, leading to some interesting conclusions about the capabilities of each analyzed tool.},

abstract = {The emerging research area of opinion mining deals with computational methods in order to find, extract and systematically analyze people’s opinions, attitudes and emotions towards certain topics. While providing interesting market research information, the user generated content existing on the Web 2.0 presents numerous challenges regarding systematic analysis, the differences and unique characteristics of the various social media channels being one of them. This article reports on the determination of such particularities, and deduces their impact on text preprocessing and opinion mining algorithms. The effectiveness of different algorithms is evaluated in order to determine their applicability to the various social media channels. Our research shows that text preprocessing algorithms are mandatory for mining opinions on the Web 2.0 and that part of these algorithms are sensitive to errors and mistakes contained in the user generated content.},

@article{Balazs2016,
abstract = {Interest in Opinion Mining has been growing steadily in the last years, mainly because of its great number of applications and the scientific challenge it poses. Accordingly, the resources and techniques to help tackle the problem are many, and most of the latest work fuses them at some stage of the process. However, this combination is usually executed without following any defined guidelines and overlooking the possibility of replicating and improving it, hence the need for a deeper understanding of the fusion process becomes apparent. Information Fusion is the field charged with researching efficient methods for transforming information from different sources into a single coherent representation, and therefore can be used to guide fusion processes in Opinion Mining. In this paper we present a survey on Information Fusion applied to Opinion Mining. We first define Opinion Mining and describe its most fundamental aspects, later explain Information Fusion and finally review several Opinion Mining studies that rely at some point on the fusion of information.},

@article{Ravi2015,
abstract = {With the advent of Web 2.0, people became more eager to express and share their opinions on web regarding day-to-day activities and global issues as well. Evolution of social media has also contributed immensely to these activities, thereby providing us a transparent platform to share views across the world. These electronic Word of Mouth (eWOM) statements expressed on the web are much prevalent in business and service industry to enable customer to share his/her point of view. In the last one and half decades, research communities, academia, public and service industries are working rigorously on sentiment analysis, also known as, opinion mining, to extract and analyze public mood and views. In this regard, this paper presents a rigorous survey on sentiment analysis, which portrays views presented by over one hundred articles published in the last decade regarding necessary tasks, approaches, and applications of sentiment analysis. Several sub-tasks need to be performed for sentiment analysis which in turn can be accomplished using various approaches and techniques. This survey covering published literature during 2002–2015, is organized on the basis of sub-tasks to be performed, machine learning and natural language processing techniques used and applications of sentiment analysis. The paper also presents open issues and along with a summary table of a hundred and sixty-one articles.},

@article{Balahur2014,
abstract = {Sentiment analysis is the natural language processing task dealing with sentiment detection and classification from texts. In recent years, due to the growth in the quantity and fast spreading of user-generated contents online and the impact such information has on events, people and companies worldwide, this task has been approached in an important body of research in the field. Despite different methods having been proposed for distinct types of text, the research community has concentrated less on developing methods for languages other than English. In the above-mentioned context, the present work studies the possibility to employ machine translation systems and supervised methods to build models able to detect and classify sentiment in languages for which less/no resources are available for this task when compared to English, stressing upon the impact of translation quality on the sentiment classification performance. Our extensive evaluation scenarios show that machine translation systems are approaching a good level of maturity and that they can, in combination to appropriate machine learning algorithms and carefully chosen features, be used to build sentiment analysis systems that can obtain comparable performances to the one obtained for English.},
